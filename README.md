# Detecting Abusive Comments in Multiple Languages: A Multilingual Approach

India is a diverse country with a rich linguistic heritage. There were 122 major languages and 1599 other languages officially spoken in India, according to 2011 Census of India. The precise number can vary depending on the standards used to define a distinct language, but it is important to keep in mind that some of these "languages" may be dialects or variations of the same language. Social media is heavily used by people in a world where internet access is expanding. As a result, there is more offensive, abusive, and hateful content on social media. For applications like controversial event extraction, creating AI chatterbots, content recommendation, and sentiment analysis, hate speech detection on Twitter is essential. The ability to categorize a tweet as racist, sexist, or neither is how we define this task. This task is very difficult because natural language constructs are so complex. Our project aims to utilize natural language processing techniques to identify negative comments posted on social media platforms. Once we have identified these negative comments, we can focus on promoting positive content on these platforms. This approach will help us create a more positive and constructive online community.
